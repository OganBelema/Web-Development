        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="bio">I am a Computer Scientist passionate about building mobile
          applications that solve problems. My approach to problem-solving is
          to research the problem, the possible solutions and design the
          solution before actually writing the code. I currently only develop
          Android applications but I plan to develop iOS applications and be a
          cloud solution expert.</p>

          <h3>Android Development</h3>
          <p>I have been developing adroid applications since 2017. I have a very good understanding of the framework and best practices. 
            I have experience with Java, Kotlin, Dependency Injection, Clean code architecture, Jetpack library, observable pattern and a lot more.</p>

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I have the foundational knowledge of web development and take courses to keep myself updated but I do not have any professional experience in a web development role. I have worked with html, css, django, react and node.js on pet projects.</p>

          <img class="cloud-eng" src="images/cloud-network.png" alt="">
          <h3>Cloud Engineering</h3>
          <p>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cloud computing. So far I have worked on a blockchain project to create and distribute and ERC20 token. I have setup a CI/CD pipeline with
            static code analysis, dyanmic testing and deployment for a django project to AWS. I have also designed a petascale HPC architcture for drug discovery using molecular docking and developed a web application using cloud services provided by AWS.</p>

          <img class="fitness" src="images/weightlifter.png" alt="">
          <h3>Fitness Training</h3>
          <p>In 2020, I decided to get back in shape and found my love once more in fitness. I decided to take it a step further by enrolling
            in a fitness training course to be a fitness trainer so I could help others get in shape. Currently, I am a certified trainer and available to give advice and share routines for anyone looking to get in shape.
